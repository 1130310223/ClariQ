# ClariQ

## Introduction

## Task Description

## ClariQ Dataset
We have extended the [Qulac](https://github.com/aliannejadi/qulac) dataset and base the competition mostly on the training data that [Qulac](https://github.com/aliannejadi/qulac) provides. In addition, we have added some new topics, question, and answers in the training set. The test set is completely unseen and newly collected. 
As such below we provide a short summary of the data characterisitics, both for the training and test set:

### ClariQ Train
Feature  							| Value
------------------------------| -----
\# topics 						| 237
\# faceted topics 				| 141
\# ambiguous topics 			| 57
\# single topics					| 39
\# facets 						| 891

### ClariQ Test
Feature  							| Value
------------------------------| -----
\# topics 						| 61	

Below, we provide a brief overview on the structure of the data, as well as a guideline on how to submit the runs.

## Files
Below we list the files in the repository:

* `./data/train.tsv` and `./data/dev.tsv` are TSV files consisting of topics (queries), facets, questions, answers, clarification need labels,
* `./data/test.tsv` is a TSV file consisting test topic ID's, as well as queries.
* `./data/question_bank.tsv` is a TSV file containing all the questions in the collection, as well as their ID's. Participants' models should select questions from this file.
* `./data/top10k_docs_dict.pkl.tar.gz` is a `dict` containing the top 10,000 document ID's retrieved from ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 collections for each topic. This may be used by the participants who wish to leverage documents content in their models. 
* `./data/single_turn_train_eval.pkl` is a `dict` containing the performance of each topic after asking a question and getting the answer. The evaluation tool that we provide uses this file to evaluate the selected questions.
* `./src/clariq_eval_tool.py` is a python script to evaluate the runs. The participants may use this tool to evaluate their models on the `dev` set. We would use the same tool to evaluate the submitted runs on the `test` set.
* `./sample_runs/` contains some sample runs and baselines. Among them, we have included the two oracle models `BestQuestion` and `WorstQuestion`, as well as the model choosing no question (`NoQuestion`). Partipicipants may check these files as sample run files. Also, they could test the evaluation tool using these files.

## File Format

### `train.tsv`, `dev.tsv`:

`train.tsv` and `dev.tsv` have exactly the same format. They contain the topics, facets, questions, answers, and clarification need labels. These are considered to be the main files, containing the labels of the training set. Note that the `clarification need` labels are already explicitly included in the files. Regarding the `question relevance` labels to each topic, these labels can be extracted implicitly from these files. In fact, each row only contains the questions that are considered to be relevant to a topic. Therefore, any other question is deemed irrelevant while computing Recall@k. 
In the `train.tsv` and `dev.tsv` files, you will find these fields:


* `topic_id`: the ID of the topic.
* `query`: the query that initiates the conversation.
* `topic_desc`: a full description of the topic as it appears in the TREC Web Track data.
* `clarification_need`: a label from 1 to 4, indicating how much it is needed to clarify a topic. If a query is self-contained and would not need any clarification, the label would be 1. While if a query is absolutely ambigouous making it impossible for a search engine to guess the right intent of the user before clarification, the label would be 4.
* `facet_id`: the ID of the facet.
* `facet_desc`: a full description of the facet (information need) as it appears in the TREC Web Track data.
* `question_id`: the ID of the question as it appears in `question_bank.tsv`.
* `question`: a clarifying question that the system can pose to the user for the current topic and facet.
* `answer`: an answer to the clarifying question, assuming that the user is in the context of the current row (i.e., the user's initial query is `query`, their information need is `facet_desc`, and `question` has been posed to the user).

Below, you can find a few example rows of `train.tsv`:

topic\_id | query | topic\_desc | clarification\_need | facet\_id | facet\_desc | question\_id | question | answer 
---------|---------|--------------|----------------------------|-------|-----------|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------
14	 | I'm interested in dinosaurs |	I want to find information about and pictures of dinosaurs. | 	4 | 	F0159	| Go to the Discovery Channel's dinosaur site, which has pictures of dinosaurs and games. | 	Q00173 | 	are you interested in coloring books | 	no i just want to find the discovery channels website
14	| I'm interested in dinosaurs | 	I want to find information about and pictures of dinosaurs.	| 4 | F0159	| Go to the Discovery Channel's dinosaur site, which has pictures of dinosaurs and games. | 	Q03021	| which dinosaurs are you interested in | 	im not asking for that i just want to go to the discovery channel dinosaur page

### `test.tsv`:
`test.tsv` only contains the list of test topics, as well as their ID's. Below we see some sample rows:

topic\_id | query
------|--------
201	 | I would like to know more about raspberry pi
202	 | Give me information on uss carl vinson.

### `question_bank.tsv`: 
`question_bank.tsv` constitutes of all the questions in the collection. So, all the question that participants may re-rank and select for the test set are also included in this question bank. The TSV file has two columnes, `question_id` which is a unique ID to the question, and `question` which is the text of the question. Below we see some example rows of the file:

question\_id | question
------|--------
Q00001 | 
Q02318 |	what kind of medium do you want this information to be in
Q02319	 | what kind of penguin are you looking for
Q02320	| what kind of pictures are you looking for

**Note:** Question id `Q00001` is reserved for cases when a models decides that asking clarifying questions is not needed. Therefore, selecting `Q00001` results in selecting no question, and reporting the performance of original `query`.

### `single_turn_train_eval.pkl`
`single_turn_train_eval.pkl` is a `dict` of document relevance results after asking each question. 
The document relevance performance is calculuated as follows:

* For a facet, the selected question and its corresponding answer is added to the document retrieval system.
* The document retrieval model [1], then re-ranks the documents with the given question and answer.
* The performance of the newly-ranked document is then computed 
For every given facet, the effect of asking the question can be determined using this `dict`. Below we see the structure of the `dict`:

	{ <evaluation metric>: 
		[ 
		  <facet_id>: 
		  {
	  	    <question_id> : 
		  	 {
		  	   'no_answer': <float>,
		  	   'with_answer': <float>
		  	 }
		  	 , ... , 
		  	 'MAX': 
		  	  {
		  	    'no_answer': <float>,
		  	    'with_answer: <float>
		  	  },
		  	 'MIN':
		  	  {
		  	    'no_answer: <float>,
		  	    'with_answer: <float>
		  	  } 
		  }
	  ]
	  ...
	}
	
As we see, one has to first identify the evaluation metric they are interested in, followed by a `facet_id` and `question_id`. Notice that here we report the retrieval performance for both with and without considering the answer to the question. Furthermore, we also include two other values, namely, `MAX` and `MIN`. These refer to the maximum and minimum performance that the retrieval model achieves by asking the "best" and "worst" question among the candidate questions, respectively. Below we see a sample of the data:

	{ 'NDCG20: 
		[ 
		  'F0513': 
		  {
	  	    'Q00045' : 
		  	 {
		  	   'no_answer': 0.2283394055312402,
		  	   'with_answer': 0.2233114358097999
		  	 }
		  	 , ... , 
		  	 'MAX': 
		  	  {
		  	    'no_answer': 0.30202557044031736,
		  	    'with_answer: 0.28863807501469424
		  	  },
		  	 'MIN':
		  	  {
		  	    'no_answer: 0.16989316652772574,
		  	    'with_answer: 0.054861833842573086
		  	  } 
		  }
	  ]
	  ...
	}
	
Notice that this `dict` contains the following evaluation metrics: 

* nDCG@{1, 3, 5, 10, 20}
* Precision@{1, 3, 5, 10, 20}
* MRR@100

**Note**: If a question is selected for a topic, that is not among the candidate questions (thus not appearing in `single_turn_train_eval.pkl`, the document relevance is assumed to be equal to `MIN` for the facet.
